## Domain of Interest

* Why are you interested in this field/domain?
  + Archita: I’m interested in learning more about Bitcoin because I’ve heard bits and pieces about its surge and fall in popularity but still know very little about what Bitcoin is exactly and how it works. I’m also curious to learn more about what factors led people to turn to cryptocurrency over standard currency. Moreover, I’d like to better understand when and why Bitcoin became popular.
  + Enoch: When I think of differences between my parents’ generation and mine, I immediately think of the technological innovations that have occurred. These notable innovations include the numerous transactions that can now be done online: we can buy stocks online through apps like Robinhood and invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. I want to learn about Bitcoin because I have yet to understand the assets that it provides. 
  + Tyrell: As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin has grown immensely popular recently. If Bitcoin fulfills its potential  (transferring currency via the net with no fees, the same value in any country,  no account freezes, no arbitrary limits, etc) this could end up being our future world-wide used currency. With this in mind, I am hoping to use data to discover why bitcoin is increasing in value and popularity, uncover the risks, and possibly educate myself to understand how to use Bitcoin in the near future.
